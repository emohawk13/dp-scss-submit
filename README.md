## Assignment - Landing Page

It's time to mix our knowledge of HTML with SCSS. Build a complete landing page with the following steps:

1. Create a custom design or replicate another page or template.

   1. Choose colors that show the message of the page (whether they compliment, contrast or are monochromatic)
   2. Design a layout that looks nice and is easy to process. Consider using tables, lists, positioning and sizing
   3. Choose fonts that match the message of your page
2. Your landing page should include the following:

   1. Navigation bar with at least 3 (three) links (whether dead or to other sites)
   2. Hero section
   3. 2 (two) informative sections
   4. Footer with the same links from the navbar
   5. At least 1 (one) CSS grid
   6. At least 1 (one) Fontawesome icon
   7. Import 1 (one) pseudo class (including hover, focus or another)

> **Note:** All links can be dead links. Remember that you will still need href's for the browser to recognize and display chosen elements as links.
